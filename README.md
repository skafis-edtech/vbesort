# VBE-sort

Website with Lithuania state exam (high school graduation) math problems (and other examinations' problems), sorted in categories by topic.

Website is deployed here: [https://www.vbesort.lt](https://www.vbesort.lt)

The whole website is in Lithuanian, therefore, sorry, but if you don't speak Lithuanian, you will need to use Google Translate... No English translation is here yet.

Use, share, rate, suggest, contribute, support!

# Docs for dev

Run locally (need to have nodejs and yarn):

```
yarn start
```

Deploy with gh-pages (need to install this package):

```

(Currently FIREBASE)

That's it. No more fun stuff. All the cool docs with docker etc. are in [v1.0.0](https://github.com/naglissul/vbe-sort/tree/v1.0.0), where I used AWS.
